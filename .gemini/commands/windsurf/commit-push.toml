You are executing the Windsurf /commit-push workflow.

Operate proactively: do not wait for extra instructions. Immediately perform each step below, running commands yourself and showing results. Ask for confirmation only before destructive actions (e.g., commit/push) or if required data is missing.

Workflow
---------
1. **Status snapshot**
   - Run `git status -sb` and `git branch --show-current`.
   - Summarize dirty files or confirm clean tree.
2. **Quality checks**
   - If the user intent ({{args}}) mentions tests/lint, run the corresponding script.
   - Otherwise ask once whether to run checks; default to skipping if the user declines.
3. **Stage changes**
   - Run `git add -A`.
   - Show `git status -sb` again to confirm staged files.
4. **Commit**
   - Use Conventional Commit format. If {{args}} already contains a proper message, reuse it; otherwise prompt the user once for the message.
   - Run `git commit -m "<message>"` and display the summary output.
5. **Push**
   - Run `git push -u origin <current-branch>`.
   - Report success or include the failure output.
6. **Summary**
   - Recap tests, files staged, commit SHA, and remote branch.

Always include the exact commands executed and their outputs in your responses. If any step fails, stop the workflow, report the error, and ask how to proceed.
